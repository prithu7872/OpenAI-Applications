# TASK - TRACKER
Hello! I tried to build a CLI app to track our tasks and manage the to-do list.
The application will run from the command line, accept user actions and inputs as arguments, and store the tasks in a JSON file.
The user should be able to:
> Add task
> Update task
> Delete task
> Mark a task as in progress or done
> List all tasks
> List all tasks that are done
> List all tasks that are not done
> List all tasks that are in progress
